# educafe
This is the repository for all code used in my "Education Cafe" youtube videos.


## statistics directory

For now, this is the only directory. As I create videos in other areas, more directories will be added. 

### R-Markdown directory

This directory contains and R/R Markdown files I use in videos. In the statistics videos, these are typically used for creating static plots, performing statistical tests, or performing sampling functions. In future videos, they will be used for other purposes (and hopefully I'll remember to update this section of the readme).

Files to note:

There is a file called colors that contains the color mapped used by manim (see section below).

### manim directory
The manim directory uses 3Blue1Brown's (Grant Sanderson's) manim package (can be found <a href='https://github.com/3b1b/manim'>here</a>). These files are used for mathematical visualizations based in python, and require the previously linked manim files and installation to work. Manim is being continually updated, so I cannot guarantee compatibility with these files.

## more directories TBA
